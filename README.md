# x-and-os

## Problem Statement
This past year, I volunteered as an assistant coach for a local high school team.  We needed an application, at a low cost, to build our game plans and brainstorm plays visually with minimal effort.

## Solution
I knew as a software engineer I could create a tool for this team to gameplan, brainstorm, and quickly add new plays to the playbook and be as creative as they could want to be.

# X and O Drawing Application

## Overview

The X and O Drawing Application is a simple WinForms application that allows users to draw on a canvas, place "X" and "O" markers, and visualize an offensive football formation. The application features a customizable background image with adjustable opacity, making it a versatile tool for both drawing and strategic planning.

## Features

- **Place Markers**:
    - Right-click to place an "O" marker.
- **Add Defense Buttons**:
    - A button to automatically add a 3-4 defensive set
          - More defensive sets to come
- **Initial Formation**: Automatically displays a basic offensive formation with four "O" markers representing linemen and one "X" for the center.
- **Save and Clear**: Options to save your drawings to a file or clear the canvas.
- **Color Changing**: Options to change the pen color of your drawing
